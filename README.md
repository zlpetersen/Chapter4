# Chapter4
#### 1. Write a program that requests and displays information:
```
Enter your first name: Betty Sue
Enter your last name: Yewe
Enter the letter grade you deserve: B
Enter your age: 22
Name: Yewe, Betty Sue
Grade: C
Age: 22
```
The program should be able to accept first names containing more than one word. The grade is also adjusted down one letter.
#### 2. Create a program using ```std::string``` that takes a name and dessert and outputs it:
```
Enter your name: Edmund
Enter your favorite dessert: turkish delight
I have some delicious turkish delight for you, Edmund.
```
#### 3. Write a program that takes the user's first and last name in ```char``` arrays  and concatenates them into one string:
```
Enter your first name: John
Enter your last name: Smith
Here's the information in a single string:
Smith, John
```
#### 4. Rewrite 3 using ```std::string``` objects instead of ```char``` arrays
#### 5. Write a program that declares the ```CandyBar``` structure with the brand, weight, and calories of the bar. Create a ```CandyBar``` variable that outputs the values:
```
Brand: Mocha Munch
Weight: 2.3
Calories: 350
```
#### 6. Rewrite 5 to create an array of three ```CandyBar``` structures, initializes them, and displays them.
```
Brand: Snickers, Weight: 1.2, Calories: 300
Brand: Milky Way, Weight: 1, Calories: 250
Brand: KitKat, Weight: 1.4, Calories: 350
```
#### 7. Create a Pizza Analysis program that takes the name of the pizza company, the diameter of the pizza, and the weight of the pizza as input:
```
Enter the name of the pizza company: Papa Murphy's
Enter the diameter of the pizza: 12
Enter the weight of the pizza: 1.5
Company: Papa Murphy's
Diameter: 12
Weight: 1.5
```
#### 8. Rewrite 7 using the ```new``` keyword to allocate memory for a structure instead of declaring it. Also have the program request the diameter before the company name:
```
Enter the diameter of the pizza: 8
Enter the name of the pizza company: Domino's
Enter the weight of the pizza: 1
Company: Domino's
Diameter: 8
Weight: 1
```
#### 9. Rewrite 6 using the ```new``` keyword to create the array dynamically
#### 10. Write a program that takes 3 times for the 40 meter dash in seconds and returns the average. Use an ```array``` object to hold the data:
```
Enter the first time in seconds: 4.22
Enter the second time in seconds: 4.52
Enter the third time in seconds: 4.26
Average time: 4.33333
```
